# Project Avacado Crumble

## Goal
The goal of the project is to provide a resource where people can enter ingredients they have on hand in thier regrigerator or pantry and be shown a list of possible recipes they can make with what they have entered.

## MVP
* Entering ingredients the user has on hand under pre-selected categories such as main, add ons, and seasonings, would show the user a list of potential recipes they could make with what they have on hand.
* Past user searches would be displayed and viewable on the page and stored in the database to persist over page refresh.
* Users would be able to add their own recipes to the site which would also be included in the search.
